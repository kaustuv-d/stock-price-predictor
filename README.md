# stock-price-predictor
This project will let us predict stock market prices of various firms. Time Series prediction Models meta's prophet and lstm model are basically implemented.
(It includes some constraints as for the companies registered after 2015, the model will raise a error while predicting, as the timeframe it is trained on is from 2015 onwards.)
